# Decompose-a-math-function
Say there is a math function that you want to use in your program:
       ⎧ x^2+1 if x<=0
f(x)=  ⎨ 1/x^2 if 0<x<1
       ⎪ x^2-1 if x>=1
The template for this function is defined below. Let's decompose it!

Your task is to create three additional functions f1, f2, and f3 for each case and complete the function f. Each function should accept x as an argument of the Double type and return a Double value.
